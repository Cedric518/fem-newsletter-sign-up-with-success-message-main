 2024/7/30 I make this readme my reflection since I dare anyone would read this.
- Learned regex
- Learned email validation
- Learned about accessiblities about forms:
aria-invalid: true
 let screen reader know the form is invalid.
role: alert
make accessitive technology read this first. Indicating that this is important

- real-time validation for input fields:
target the event 'input' and do validation
